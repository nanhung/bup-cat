- **datasets:** The raw bupropion PK data and physicological/chemical-specific parameters.

- **MCSim:** The source fils of GNU MCSim software and the related modeling files that can conduct MCMC simulation and prediction.

- **outputs**: The files in the output folder are generated by the above R code and datasets.

- **plots:** All plots showed in the manuscript were saved with *fig{number}.jpeg*. The **suppl**  folder includes the supplementary figures.
